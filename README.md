## Background
BadBunny is a Puerto Rican rapper who has gained global success as a rapper. As a fan I wanted to explore his song performance overtime.  
Some questions I explored included:
- How long does will a BadBunny song stay on the Top 200?
- What BadBunny songs have globally performed the best?
- What are BadBunny's top 3 performing songs?

## The Data
The data comes from Kaggle and features Spotify song data from 2017-2021 : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/spotify-charts/code <br>
Alperen Karan's notebook was a helpful resource as a did my analysis: https://www.kaggle.com/code/alperenkaran/spotify-top50-charts-analysis/notebook?scriptVersionId=88893676

## The Findings
- BadBunny's performs best in Spanish speaking countries (shocking! I know).
- Yonaguni is BadBunny's most streamed and highest ranking single globally :cherry_blossom:. 
- Most BadBunny songs will be on Spotify's Top200 for 1-20 days.
  - MIA (feat. BadBunny) was on the Top 200 for 362 days (almost a year)
### Which Got me thinking about MIA (feat. Drake)...
Looking at MIA (feat. Drake) rank averages and it turns out this song acted as BadBunny's crossover hit.
