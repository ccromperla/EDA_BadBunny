## Background
BadBunny is a Puerto Rican rapper who has gained global success as a rapper. As a fan I wanted to explore his song performance overtime.  
Some questions I explored included:
- How long does will a BadBunny song stay on the Top 200?
- What BadBunny songs have globally performed the best?
- What are BadBunny's top 3 performing songs?

## The Data
The data comes from Kaggle and features Spotify song data from 2017-2021 : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/spotify-charts/code <br>
Alperen Karan's notebook was a helpful resource as a did my analysis: https://www.kaggle.com/code/alperenkaran/spotify-top50-charts-analysis/notebook?scriptVersionId=88893676

## The Findings
- BadBunny's performs best in Spanish speaking countries (shocking! I know).
- Yonaguni is BadBunny's most streamed and highest ranking single globally :cherry_blossom:. 
- Most BadBunny songs will be on Spotify's Top200 for 1-20 days.
  - MIA (feat. BadBunny) was on the Top 200 for 362 days (almost a year)
### Which Got me thinking about MIA (feat. Drake)...
Looking at MIA (feat. Drake) rank averages and it turns out this song acted as BadBunny's crossover hit.<br>

The blue line in the middle is MIA (feat.Drake) and what follows the orange is Vete, which led up to the release of BadBunny's YHLQMDLG. 
Globally, MIA (feat. Drake) seems to haveacted as the single that introduced listeners to him and as a result, globally, there was greater interest in BadBunny and his music. I hate to give Champagne Papi any credit, but it seems the feature helped launch BadBunny as a global artist. Although, it seems that BadBunny no longer needs Drake to see the level of success, per Yonaguni's performance.
